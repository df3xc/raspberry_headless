Headless Operation of Raspberry

git clone https://github.com/df3xc/raspberry_headless.git

cd raspberry_headless

chmod 777 install.sh

This script installs some packages which I find useful for headless operation:

* MONO - the DOT.NET framework for GNU/Linux
* SAMBA - mount Raspberry from Windows PC
* APACHE - The WEB Server
*PHP

It installs some basic tools

*TCPDUMP
*I2C-TOOLS
*VLAN
